# capstoneProject
This project is my "Capstone Project" to showcase all that I have learned from completing The Odin Project, an open-source coding bootcamp to becoming a full stack web developer. 

This repo contains the Server Side Rendering using Express/Node.js and Client Side Rendering using React.
