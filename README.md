# capstoneProject

This project is my "Capstone Project" to showcase all that I have learned from completing The Odin Project, an open-source full stack development course, to becoming a full stack web developer.

This repo contains the Server Side Rendering using Express/Node.js and Client Side Rendering using React.

This application has been deployed using Vercel for the client and Render for the server.

- Please note: I am using the free version of Render to store my server side application Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process. Spinning up a service takes a few seconds, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running.
